# Brundle_Example

Two example workflows that process datasets using Brundle.

**ctcfExample.Rmd** provides a complete workflow using data that was 
generated with an internal CTCF based control.

**dmExample.Rmd** shows a similar workflow for data with a spike-in control.

**Preprocessing** contains examples of how to preprocess the samples. This includes
the pipleline to align reads a merged human-drosophila genome and sample raw data in
FastQ format.

Brundle can be found at https://github.com/andrewholding/Brundle

Examples_for_package.R was used to provide the R data files (.rda) for the
man page examples in the Brundle package.
