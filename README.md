# Brundle_Example

Two workflows that processes a reduced dataset using Brundle based on only
chromosome 22. This is to keep the all the genomic data small enough to remain 
inside GitHub's file size limit.

ctcfExample.Rmd shows provides complete workflow using same data and was 
generated using a CTCF based control.

dmExample.Rmd shows a similar workflow for data using a spike-in control.

Preprocessing example with sample data can be found in the preprocessing folder.

Brundle can be found at https://github.com/andrewholding/Brundle

Examples_for_package.R was used to provide the R data files (.rda) for the
man page examples in the Brundle package.
