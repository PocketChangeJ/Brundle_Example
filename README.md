# Brundle_Example

A simple workflow that processes a reduced dataset using Brundle based on only
chromosome 22. This is to keep the all the genomic data small enough to remain 
inside GitHub's file size limit.

Examples_for_package.R was used to provide the R data files (.rda) for the
man page examples in the Brundle package.

example.Rmd shows provides complete workflow using the same data.
