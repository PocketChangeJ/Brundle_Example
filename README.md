# Brundle_Example

A simple workflow that processes a reduced dataset using Brundle based on only
chromosome 22. This is to keep the all the genomic data small enough to remain 
inside GitHub's file size limit.

It provides examples for two methods of normalisation for the data and generates
the R data objects included in the Brundle package.
