In this directory are all the scripts needed to download, generate and align to a 
merged genome. 

To test the pipleline an experimental dataset with reads that map to human and
drosophila is included in the dmhsReads folder. To conserve filesize only
reads for Chr22 in human and Chr4 in drosophila are included.

The final output is included in the BrundleData package as an example.
